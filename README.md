# Data Sourcing

In this activity, I was able to source data using Json and parse through to find specific values. The only thing was that I called the url to many times and went over the quota.
I was not able to see the final outcome because I needed to wait 24 hours before retrying the url. Unfornately, the assignment is due. So I decided to submnit for now, and finish the code after the submission if it doesn't work for the grader.
